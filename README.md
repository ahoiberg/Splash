measuring vital signs based off activity and environment

This extends the technology developed by Sensoria, Inc. 
Developed during PennApps winter 2015

Develops ways to measure the following while an individual is running (with Sensoria technology)
Location
Weather/Running Conditions
Hydration state
Signs of pronation

NOTE: none of these calculations have any basis in empirical data. They are developed simply using logic for purposes of demonstration. 

Weather/location info comes from WU Underground.
